Basic concepts

1.Setup.bash
Intro: Allow users to have access to some ROS commands. 

Sourcing two different setup.bash:
(1)source /opt/ros/melodic(noedic)/setup.bash
Intro: to have access to the ROS commands when opening new shells.(before catkin_make)
(2)source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Intro: to add the workspace to ROS environment after building packages.(after catkin_make)


2.Catkin workspace
Intro: a folder where you modify, build, and install catkin packages.

Content:
(1)Source space
Intro: containing the source code of catkin packages. 
(2)Build space
Intro: where cmake and make are called to build the catkin packages.
(3)Development (Devel) space 
Intro: where built targets are placed before being installed.
(4)Install space
Intro: install the targets.


3.Manifests (package.xml)
Intro: a description of a package. Containing defined dependencies between packages, version, maintainer, license, etc...

4.Catkin packages
Intro: a package that meets the following requirements:
(1)contain a package.xml.
(2)contain a CMakeLists.txt.
(3)no nested packages nor multiple packages sharing the same directory.

5.REP128
Intro: a naming convention.

6.Node
Intro: an executable cpp or python documents.

7.Message
Intro: a simple data type of information transmitted when subscribing or publishing to a topic.

8.Topic
Intro: nodes don’t know who they are communicating with, so a topic is needed for nodes to subscribe or publish to.

9.Master
Intro: enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. 

10.Rqt_graph
Intro: showing the connection between nodes through topics.


Basic commands

1.printenv | grep ROS
Intro: print environment variables.

2.source filename or . filename
Intro: execute initialization documents.

3.catkin_make
Intro: called at ~/catkin_ws/, used to build any packages located in ~/catkin_ws/src. (with cmake)

Remark: 
Make: just compile what is changed.
Build: completely compile all.

4.sudo apt-get install package_name
Intro: install ROS packages.

5.pwd
Intro: print the path of current directory

6.echo *
Intro: display something on the screen (e.g. environment variables)

7.mkdir (-p) package_name
Intro: create an empty directory.

1.rospack find
Intro: find packages by names.

2.roscd
Intro: change directory.

3.rosls
Intro: list the documents inside a package.

4.catkin_create_pkg package_name dependency1 dependency2 ...
Intro: create a catkin package.

5.roscore
Intro: a command to run before using any ROS nodes.

6.rosnode list
Intro: list the currently running nodes.

7.rosnode ping node_name
Intro: test if the node is successfully connected to computer.

8.rosrun package_name node_name ( __name:=new_node_name)
Intro: use the package name to directly run a node within a package (without having to know the package path).

9.rostopic echo topic_name
Intro: display the data of a topic.

10.rostopic type topic_name
Intro: print the type of the topic.

Remark:
