# Configuration

Before using Jaka MiniCobo, the following configuration must be done.

## 1 Connection

There are two ways of connection, see [here](https://github.com/SUSTech-AMASLAB/JAKA-MiniCobo/blob/main/Notes/2.%E6%9C%BA%E6%A2%B0%E8%87%82%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95/2.%E6%9C%BA%E6%A2%B0%E8%87%82%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95.md). In this project, I chose to connect the wifi of Jaka's IPC.

## 2 Python API

In this project, I used Python to control the robotic arm. You can download some references from [here](https://www.jaka.com/jszl.html). You can also view the tutorials from [here](https://github.com/HenryWJL/JAKA-MiniCobo/blob/main/SDK/python%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91.pdf).
